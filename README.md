React-Redux, ReduxJS Toolkit, Axios

This project is about retrieving data from an api: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/", and then display the response data to the UI. It also features reduxjs toolkit for easy manipulation of states and data.

User Interaction: Press the DOWNLOAD USERDATA AS EXCEL to download the data displayed on the UI.

## Features

- React-Redux, it is a third-party library that allows managing application state. It can be used as a central storage area so components only need to retrieve data from the same place and since it comes from the same central storage, data can be instantaneously synced.
- Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
